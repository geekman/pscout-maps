PScout Mapping Parser
======================
PScout is a project that analyzes Android to map API calls to permission use.
This handy mapping allows us to define "API calls of interest".
More information can be found <http://pscout.csl.toronto.edu/>.

All pscout-*.txt mapping files come from the PScout project, found above.

`parse_pscout.py` is a hacked-up script that parses the PScout mapping output 
to transform it to any format you want.
